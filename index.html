        <p>Hi Jassen,</p>
        <p>Happiest Birthday to you <span>&#127881;</span>, I know that i've never got a chance to get you something special last year and greet you hahaha, 
          (I've forgot the exact date. sorry &#128513; &#9996;). Anyways you gave me an idea to send you also a card like you send to me last year.
          I just hope that you appreciate this thing hahaha &#128513;, I'm not confident on the design haha but still keeping the design simple (i didn't create it from scratch, i just found it on internet hahaha &#128513; my apologies).
          This is only 2% percent of my coding skills lol (i will be better next time  &#128521; &#128521;).
          <p>
            Kidding aside, Wishing you all the best and good luck with your studies(Ga-graduate na siya! naks hahahah), Take care of yourself and I hope this year brings you all the happiness, success, and fulfillment 
            you desire. May all your dreams come true, and may your heart be filled with love and laughter always  &#10084; &#10084; &#10084;.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Sending you lots of love, hugs, and warm wishes on your birthday. Enjoy your special day to the fullest! &#10084;.
